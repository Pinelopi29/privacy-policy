  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Room8</strong> built the <strong>Room8</strong> app as a freemium app. This service is provided by Pinelopi Constantinou and is intended for use as is.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>This app does not collect personally identifiable information. If the app requests access to your device features (such as camera, storage, or internet), it is only used for the app’s core functionality and not stored or shared.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app may use third-party services (such as Google Play Services, Google Play Billing, or analytics) that collect information to identify you.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>I value your trust and use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed toward children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for changes.</p>
